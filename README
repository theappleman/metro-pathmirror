metro - path/mirror
=======

This is a skeleton path/mirror directory for use with metro, funtoo's
automated distribution build tool.

Included here are the /.control/ files that guide the building process
for each supported arch (bits in parenthesis are bits):
x86 and ~x86 (32)
i686 and ~i686 (32)
amd64 and ~amd64 (64)
core2 and ~core2 (64)
opteron and ~opteron (64)
~athlon-xp (32)
~core2_32 (32)
~opteron_32 (32)
~pentium4 (32)

If you have an amd64-compatible CPU, you can use metro to create amd64 and
x86 stages, and their deriviatives.

If you have an 32-bit x86 CPU, you are only able to create x86 and derived
stages.

An 64-bit seed stage cannot create a 32-bit stage.

Most 32-bit stages require the i686 (or its derivative) stages as a seed.
This is reflected in the control files with the caveat: you must either create
or download an i686 seed stage before commencing the build for derived targets.

get
===
To run get, you must pass the distribution and arch for it to download.
The distributions are: funtoo, ~funtoo or gentoo.

./get funtoo x86


By default, it fetches the stage from heanet mirrors (Republic of Ireland);
you can change this by giving the base url of the mirror to use as a third
argument:

./get ~funtoo core2 http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/funtoo/

Currently there are only 4 mirrors you can use:
